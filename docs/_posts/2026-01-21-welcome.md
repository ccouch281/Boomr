Welcome to the official development log for **Boomr**. This blog will serve as a central hub for updates, technical deep dives, and behind-the-scenes looks at the development of my Unreal Engine 4 project.

## Why a Dev Blog?
Game development is a journey of constant learning and iteration. By documenting my process, I hope to:

*   Keep track of my progress and decisions.
*   Share knowledge with the broader game dev community.
*   Maintain a history of my technical decisions.

## The Vision: Arena meets Tactical
My goal is to create a First Person Shooter that blends properties of arena-style shooters with tactical gameplay, very much in the vein of *Halo: Combat Evolved*.

I've been disappointed in the official *Halo 1* remakes and spiritual successors over the years. They never quite capture the magic of the original. I'm hoping to build something that finally fills that void—a game that respects the golden era of shooters while feeling fresh and modern.

## Call for Contributors
I am a programmer first and foremost. While I can handle the code and gameplay logic, I have gaps in my skillset that I'll need help filling.

If you are interested in this vision and have skills in:

*   **3D Modeling & Art** (Characters, Environments, Weapons)
*   **Level Design** (Mapping, Flow, Item Placement)
*   **Animation** (Rigging, Gameplay Animations)
*   **Sound Design** (SFX, Music)
*   **UI/UX Design** (HUD, Menus)
*   **Server Architecture & Networking**

Please reach out or check the GitHub repository issues. I'd love to collaborate with others who share this passion for the classic tactical-arena hybrid genre.

## Getting Help: The Power of AI
I plan to write tutorials and quickstart guides as we progress, but if you run into specific problems or need to learn a new concept quickly, I highly recommend using an AI assistant. They are infinitely better at providing immediate, context-aware help than I could ever be. Best of all, they are all largely free to use.

Personally, I am using **Google Gemini 3** to help build this project.

Here are some of the most popular AI assistants:
